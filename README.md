# OPPID: Single Sign-On with Oblivious Pairwise Pseudonyms

The prototypical protocol implementation and its benchmarks have been moved to the [OPPID-artifacts](https://github.com/jmakr0/OPPID-artifacts) repository, which will maintain the state used in the paper. The OPPID code itself may also be relocated and further developed in this repository. In the meantime, please refer to [OPPID-artifacts](https://github.com/jmakr0/OPPID-artifacts).
